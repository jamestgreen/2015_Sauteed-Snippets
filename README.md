A website that collects one-line excerpts from my daily journals.

For years, I've been keeping a daily journal of whatever is on my mind, from drawn out musings to short-form quips.As part of a current series that will result in a book, I built the website sauteedsnippets.com to collect one-line snippets from journal entries. This project will be ongoing.

The website doesn't automatically pull information from my journals, it's just an online archive in which the individual entries are manually entered as tags.
